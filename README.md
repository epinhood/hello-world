# hello-world
My first eddy on github, this repository is a place where I can store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
In terms of introductory remarks, I am a seasoned Clinical Epidemiologist; Medic; Agile Project Manager; DevOps and Data Science Entrepreneur on a mission to create a more innovative, accessible, and affordable suite of Algorithms, Web-Based Apps, and DevOps Tooling for Primary Care Providers, Health Data Scientists, Patients and their Advocates. I will be collaborating with groups and individuals for this partnership who share my passion for innovative analytic methods and open-source solutions for demonstrating impact on equity, quality, and value of Health Care and Public Health Interventions at the grassroots level. 
My purpose is to develop an entirely open-sourced platform, that is pre-validated and reliable, which can be rescaled and marketed for additional Private and Public opportunities, including but not limited to existing or new solutions supporting; identification, outreach, and engagement of vulnerable individuals and populations with disproportionate risk and/or outcome burdens; value-based care quality performance reporting, passive and active disease surveillance, outbreak control, propensity score matching, predictive model tuning, environmental risk and hazard assessment, observational study design, outcome-based performance indicators, and benchmarking.
One step at a time though, first I need to work through my Hello World - Github Guide:)
